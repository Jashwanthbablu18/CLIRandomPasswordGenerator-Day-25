This is a  program  which was designed as part of my "30-Day Python Challenge." 

For ExternalFile.py
The provided code is a Python script for generating random passwords.
1. Imports:
   - import random: This imports Python's built-in random module, which is used to generate random numbers and selections.
   - import string: This imports the string module, which provides access to common string constants like letters and digits.
2. def generate_password(): This function defines a function named generate_password that takes two optional parameters:
     - length: The desired length of the password, defaulting to 12 characters if not specified.
     - use_special_chars: A boolean flag indicating whether to include special characters in the password, defaulting to True.
3. Input Validation:
   - if length < 6:: This checks if the specified length is less than 6.
   - If the length is less than 6, the function returns a warning message indicating that the password should be at least 6 characters 
     long.
4. Character Set Construction:
   - chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits: This creates a string (chars) containing all uppercase and lowercase letters 
     (string.ascii_letters) and digits (string.digits).
   - if use_special_chars: chars += string.punctuation: If use_special_chars is True, special characters (string.punctuation) are added 
     to the chars string.
5. Password Generation:
   - password = ''.join(random.sample(chars, length)): This line generates the password by randomly selecting a sample of unique 
     characters from the chars string, with the size of the sample equal to the specified length. The random.sample function ensures 
     that characters are not repeated, and ''.join(...) constructs the final password string by concatenating the selected characters.
6. Return Statement:
   - return password: The generated password is returned as the output of the function.


For Day-25Code.py
The provided code is a Python script for generating random passwords.
1. from ExternalFile import generate_password:
   this imports generate_password function from ExternalFile.py to generate password.
2. main():
   - The 'try' block tries to take length of the password as input.
   - It also tries to take input to include any special chars or not, if 'y' then includes other than this won't include.
   - And passes these length and special params into generate_password() function to generate password based on requirements.
   - It manages any invalid length input by excepting with user friendly msg.
3. if __name__ == "__main__":
   This calls main() to start execution of program.


What I've learnt:
- Module: It is a python file containing python code(with '.py' extension) it consists of defined functions, classes and variables where
  we can reuse them in another programs. eg: math, os, random... . We can create it by our own and use by importing them.
- PIP: It stands for "Python Installer Package", which is used to install additional libraries, dependencies and packages that which 
  aren't available in standard library. We can install by using command 'pip install <PACKAGE_NAME>
- PyPI: It stands for "Python Package Index", This is a repository of python packages contributed by the community.So when we run 
  `pip install` it pulls from this only.
- So we know that we have Modules, Packages, Library and Framework looks similar but they've distinct meanings:
   -> Module: A module is a single Python file (.py) that contains code — functions, variables, and classes — you can import and use. 
      It is smallest unit of reusable code.
   -> Package: A package is a collection of modules grouped together in a directory with an __init__.py file (can be empty). Allows for 
      hierarchical structuring of code (sub-packages, etc.).
   -> Library: A library is a collection of modules and/or packages that offer specific functionality. It’s a broader term — could be a 
      single module or a full package with many modules.
   -> Framework: A framework is a large, structured library or collection of libraries that provides a foundation and dictates how our 
      code should be written. 
- Advantages of Modules: 
   1, Code Reusability
   2, Better organization of code
   3, Standard library access
- Advantages of PIP:
   1, Easy package installation
   2, Dependency management
   3, Uninstallation and upgrading
- Advantages of PyPI:
   1, It has massive library collection
   2, Community contributions
   3, Centeralized resource
   4, Integration with PIP
