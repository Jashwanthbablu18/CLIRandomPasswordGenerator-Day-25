# 🔐 Day 25 - Random Password Generator (Using `random` Module)

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to **Day 25** of my **#30DaysOfPythonChallenge**. Today, I built a secure password generator using Python’s powerful `random` module!

---

## 📌 What’s This About?
Today’s focus:  
- Generating secure, randomized passwords  
- Leveraging Python’s built-in `random` and `string` modules  
- Writing clean, modular, and reusable code

---

## 💭 Why Is This Useful?
Strong passwords are crucial for protecting online accounts. This app makes it easy to generate complex passwords that include:
- Uppercase and lowercase letters
- Digits
- Special characters (optional)

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔢 Define your own password length
- 🎲 Use `random.sample()` to shuffle characters securely
- ✅ Optionally include or exclude special characters
- ⚠️ Enforces minimum length for better security
- 📁 Organized codebase with reusable modules

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Built with:
- 🐍 **Python 3**
- `random.sample()` for non-repetitive random selection
- `string.ascii_letters`, `string.digits`, `string.punctuation`
- Custom reusable functions via `import`

---

## 🚀 Run the Program

Make sure you’re inside the `random_password_app/` directory, then run:
```bash
python Day-25Code.py
